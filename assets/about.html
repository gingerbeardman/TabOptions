    Tab Options adds a few tab-related options to the ones built into Safari. It also lets you assign custom hotkeys for several tab operations. Finally, it lets you assign hotkeys to open favorite URLs.</p>

<h4>Options</h4>

<dl><dt>New tab positioning</dt>
    <dd>
        You can decide what position new tabs will appear in on the tab bar. If you don&rsquo;t like the default position, you can have new tabs open to either side of the current tab or at either end of the tab bar. There are independent settings for foreground tabs and background ones.
    </dd>
    <dt>Focus on close</dt>
    <dd>
        You can decide which tab will be focused (activated) when you close a tab. Safari uses a certain logic to determine this, but you can override it by having Tab Options always focus the tab to the left or the right of the former tab. Most interestingly, you can opt to focus the <em>last focused tab</em>, wherever it is in the tab order.
    </dd>
    <dt>Closing the last tab</dt>
    <dd>
        Normally, when you close the last (or only) tab in a window, Safari closes the whole window. If you don&rsquo;t like that, you can set Tab Options to keep the window open by emptying the tab or by loading a URL of your choice in it. Note: Due to a bug in Safari, this option only has effect when you close the tab using a Tab Options hotkey.

</div>

<p>
    These are the operations you can assign hotkeys to.</p>

<ul><li>Open a new foreground or background tab</li>
    <li>Switch to the left or right tab</li>
    <li>Switch to the last active (focused) tab</li>
    <li>Cycle through all tabs in the order they were last activated</li>
    <li>Go back (like clicking the Back button) or forward in the current tab</li>
    <li>Close the current tab</li>
    <li>Reopen recently-closed tabs, one by one</li>
    <li>Duplicate the current tab</li>
    <li>Duplicate the current tab and go back</li>
    <li>Reload the current tab</li>
    <li>Move the current tab to the left or to the right</li>
    <li>Move the current tab to the left or right end of the tab bar</li>
</ul><p>
    For each action, you can assign up to three keyboard shortcuts. For example, you could assign lowercase “w”, uppercase “W”, and ç (Option-C) to Close Tab. Only &ldquo;printing&rdquo; keys are supported, either alone or in combination with Command, Option, and/or Shift. Special keys such as Home, PageDown, NumLock, and the arrow keys are not supported.</p>

<p>
    You can also define hotkeys for any number of URLs that you specify, and you can open each of them in either a foreground or a background tab.</p>

<h4>Blacklist</h4>

<p>
    You can decide where tabs that you open with Tab Options will appear. If you don&rsquo;t like the default position, you can have new tabs open to either side of the current tab or at either end of the tab bar. (This setting only affects tabs you open with Tab Options.)</p>
